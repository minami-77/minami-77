## Hi I'm Minami ðŸ‘‹

I am a former public sector specialist with experience in international relations, policy coordination, and education administration. 
After completing a 24-week web development boot camp, where I learned Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and more, I am transitioning into a bilingual developer career and seeking opportunities in Tokyo. 
Driven by a desire to develop specialized technical skills, I pursued web development to apply my problem-solving and project management abilities in new ways.
